# Insider Threat TTP Knowledge Base

To advance our collective understanding of insider threats, the Center for
Threat-Informed Defense developed the Insider Threat TTP Knowledge Base, a collection of
TTPs used by insiders in IT environments. This Knowledge Base builds upon data collected
on insider threat incidents and lessons learned and experience from the ATT&CK® knowledge
base. With this lexicon of known insider threat TTPs as a foundation, defenders will
detect, mitigate, and emulate insider actions on IT systems and stop them.

## Getting Involved

This initial Knowledge Base is an evidence-based examination of detected, documented
insider threat actions on IT systems from across various organizations and industries.
There are several ways that you can get involved with this work and help advance
threat-informed defense:

- **Review the KB, use it, and tell us what you think.** We need your help to validate
  or refute this initial analysis. We welcome your review and feedback on the
  methodology and resources.
- **Apply the methodology and share your data.** We seek to learn about your insider
  threat use cases and data sources, enabling us to mature this KB and raise the level
  of difficulty for any insider. Help us expand the knowledge base by contributing your
  data. Contact us at ctid@mitre-engenuity.org to learn more about contributing to the
  knowledge base.
- **Share your ideas.** We are interested in developing additional resources to help the
  community understand and make threat-informed decisions regarding insider threat. If
  you have ideas or suggestions, please let us know.
