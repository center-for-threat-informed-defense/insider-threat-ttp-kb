# Insider Threat Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) Knowledge Base
To advance our collective understanding of insider threats, the Center for Threat-Informed Defense developed the Insider Threat TTP Knowledge Base, a collection of TTPs used by insiders in IT environments. This Knowledge Base builds upon
data collected on insider threat incidents and lessons learned and experience from the ATT&CK knowledge base. With this lexicon of known insider threat TTPs as a foundation, defenders will detect, mitigate, and emulate insider actions on IT systems and stop them.

## Call for Contributors
This initial Knowledge Base is an evidence-based examination of detected, documented insider threat actions on IT systems from across various organizations and industries. We need your help to validate or refute this initial analysis. We seek to learn about your insider threat use cases and data sources, enabling us to mature this KB and raise the level of difficulty for any insider. Help us expand the knowledge base by contributing your data.

Contributions must fit the guidelines listed below:
- Actions that involve the use of IT systems and can be detected through structured data logs
- TTPs that are validated by documentation (e.g., exist within an organization's case files or tracking system). Details, at a minimum, must include
(1) a corresponding technique and tactic (either an existing ATT&CK technique or a proposed technique), (2) a date or date/time offset, (3) a data source, and (4) contextual information describing the event.
- Details that would identify an organization or individuals should be anonymized

Example
| Technique ID | Sub-Technique ID | Technique Name | Proposed Tactic Group | Timestamp | Data Source | Log type within source | Notes                 |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------|-------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
