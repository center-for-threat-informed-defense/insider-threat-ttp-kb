Observable Human Indicators 
============================

What is an Observable Human Indicator?
---------------------------------------
Observable human indicators (OHI) are objective or quantifiable facts about a person, their job or their role. These indicators do not involve beliefs, feelings, or opinions nor are they related to a personâ€™s race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, or disability. We hope that by collecting this data, we will gain insight into the types of individuals more likely to become insider threats.

The Center team has factored OHIs into the data collection portal for future cases and will be adding the analysis of those indicators here in the future.
