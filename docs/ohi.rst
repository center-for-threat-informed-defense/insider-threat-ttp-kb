Observable Human Indicators
===========================

Observable human indicators (OHIs) are objective or quantifiable facts about a person,
their job or their role. These indicators do not involve beliefs, feelings, or opinions
nor are they related to a personâ€™s race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, or
disability. We hope that by collecting this data, we will gain insight into the types of
individuals more likely to become insider threats.

The Center team has factored OHIs into the data collection portal for future cases and
will be adding the analysis of those indicators here in the future.

We are collecting the following OHIs in our case data:

    * Subject had elevated privileges
    * Monitoring status of subject
    * Telework status of subject
    * Performance Improvement Plan required
    * Turnover rate of subject's role
    * Time at company
    * Management level
    * Seniority of subject
    * Government security clearance
