Identifying and Mitigating Threats
==================================

The MITRE ATT&CK® framework has mapped data sources and mitigations, where applicable, to each of the techniques detailed in the ATT&CK® for Enterprise framework. These have been validated in terms of external actors, but the Center research team behind the Insider Threat Knowledge Base is validating these for their applicability to insider threats as well. The Center team is working under the assumption that many or most of the mitigations and data sources listed will help both efforts, but that there will likely be some differences or additional data sources and mitigations for insider threat.

Mitigations 
------------
Mitigations have been identified through their mappings to ATT&CK® TTPs and through validation by Center participants. Currently all insider threat TTPs within the Knowledge Base are also TTPs in ATT&CK®, therefore those ATT&CK® identified mitigations have been considered. Through discussion with participants, further mitigations may be identified in the future however as of the latest release, all mitigations for ATT&CK® for enterprise have been able to be identified as useful for insider threat as well. 
The chart below details the tactic, technique and mitigation mappings specific to insider threat. 


Data Sources
-------------
Data sources that are useful for providing relevant information for insider threat identification have been detailed. Identifying the most common data sources to detect insider threat will enhance the communities' ability to mitigate insider threat. The data sources have been identified first through mappings from ATT&CK®, like the mitigations, with follow-on confirmation from Center participants.
