Mitigations and Data Sources
=============================

The MITRE ATT&CK framework has mapped data sources and mitigations, where applicable, to each of the techniques detailed in the framework. These have been validated in terms of external actors, but the MITRE research team behind the Insider Threat Knowledge Base wanted to validate these for applicability to insider threats. We are working under the assumption that many or most of the mitigations and data sources listed will help both efforts, but that there will likely be some differences or additional data sources and mitigations.

Mitigations 
------------
Mitigations have been identified through their mappings to ATT&CK TTPs and through validation by Center participants. Currently all insider threat TTPs within the Knowledge Base are also TTPs in ATT&CK, therefore those identified mitigations have been considered. Through discussion with participants, further mitigations may be identified.

Data Sources
-------------
Identifying the most common data sources to detect insider threat will enhance the communities ability to prevent further threats. The data sources will be identified first through mappings from ATT&CK, like the mitigations. However, Center participants have identified and confirmed the data sources used for each detected TTP.
