Mitigations and Data Sources
=============================

Mitigations 
------------
Mitigations have been identified through their mappings to ATT&CK TTPs and through validation by Center participants. Currently all insider threat TTPs within the Knowledge Base are also TTPs in ATT&CK, therefore those identified mitigations have been considered. Through discussion with participants, further mitigations may be identified. 

Data Sources
-------------
Identifying the most common data sources to detect insider threat will enhance the communities ability to prevent further threats. The data sources will be identified first through mappings from ATT&CK, like the mitigations. However, Center participants have identified and confirmed the data sources used for each detected TTP.
