`CTI Blueprints <https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/cti-blueprints/wiki>`__ - *June 2023*
    This project developed an approach and prototype tool for creating narrative cyber
    threat intel reports that analysts need in the form they need them. Reports produced
    using CTI Blueprints include structured STIX content, are tagged with ATT&CK reference,
    and enable operational defensive cyber analysis, analytics testing, and adversary
    emulation. We will establish a new normal for cyber threat intelligence. Producers will
    create actionable intelligence for their consumers, and consumers will take specific
    threat-informed action.

`Defending IAAS with ATT&CK
<https://center-for-threat-informed-defense.github.io/defending-iaas-with-attack/>`__ -
*November 2022*
    Defending IaaS with ATT&CK developed an ATT&CK matrix that enables users to easily
    understand and work with the techniques applicable to Infrastructure-as-a-Service
    (IaaS) environments, regardless of whether the attacks target the cloud management
    layer, the container technology, or the hosted infrastructure. The project also
    developed documentation and tools to simplify creating overlays for other domains
    like Industrial Control Systems (ICS) or Operational Technology (OT).

`Sensor Mappings <https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/sensor-mappings-to-attack>`__ – *December 2023*
    The Sensor Mappings to ATT&CK Project (SMAP) is a collection of resources to assist
    security operations teams and security leaders with understanding which tools,
    capabilities, and events can help provide visibility into real-world adversary
    behaviors potentially occurring in their environments. SMAP builds on MITRE ATT&CK®
    Data Sources by connecting the conceptual data source representations of information
    that can be collected to concrete logs, sensors, and other security capabilities
    that provide that type of data.

`Sightings Ecosystem <https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/our-work/sightings-ecosystem/>`__  - *February 2022*
    This project provides cybersecurity defenders and researchers with critical insight
    into real-world, in the wild adversary behaviors mapped to ATT&CK. The ecosystem
    aims to fundamentally advance the collective ability to see threat activity across
    organizational, platform, vendor and geographical boundaries. Voluntarily
    contributed raw “sightings”, or observations, of specific adversary TTPs are mapped
    to ATT&CK, anonymized, and aggregated to produce intelligence describing insights
    from that data.

`Summiting The Pyramid <https://center-for-threat-informed-defense.github.io/summiting-the-pyramid/>`__ – *September 2023*
    Many analytics are dependent on specific tools or artifacts. Adversaries can easily
    evade these with low-cost changes that exploit the dependencies. This project
    developed a method to evaluate analytics relative to the adversary’s cost to evade.
    We further created approaches and tips for defenders to make their analytics less
    evadable. We demonstrated the methodology with a core set of analytics.

`Threat Report ATT&CK Mapper <https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/our-work/threat-report-attck-mapper-tram/>`__ - *August 2023*
