**MITRE ATT&CK:** MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK® knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.
  
   **Tactic:** Tactics represent the "why" of an ATT&CK® technique or sub-technique. 
   
   **Technique:** Techniques represent 'how' an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action.
   
   **Procedure:** Procedures are the specific implementation the adversary uses for techniques or sub-techniques.

   **Data Source:** Data sources represent the various subjects/topics of information that can be collected by sensors/logs.

   **Mitigations:** Mitigations represent security concepts and classes of technologies that can be used to prevent a technique or sub-technique from being successfully executed.

**Insider Threat:** An insider threat is defined as the threat that an insider will use their authorized access, wittingly or unwittingly, to do harm to the department’s mission, resources, personnel, facilities, information, equipment, networks, or systems.

**Observable Human Indicators:** Observable human indicators (OHI) are objective or quantifiable facts about a person, their job or their role. These indicators do not involve beliefs, feelings, or opinions nor are they related to a person’s race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, or disability. We hope that by collecting this data, we will gain insight into the types of individuals more likely to become insider threats.
