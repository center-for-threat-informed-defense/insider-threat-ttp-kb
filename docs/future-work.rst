Future Work
===========

Case Collection
---------------

The portal will continue to be available and accepting cases for future analysis. The
Knowledge Base seeks contributions from new organizations in more industries to broaden
the project's visibility. When more cases have been collected, Center researchers will
be able to do additional statistical analysis and create a more generalizable Knowledge
Base.

Additional OHIs
---------------

Along with the OHIs that are currently being collected, the team is always on the
lookout for additional data that should be collected. The collection of additional OHIs
will allow insider threat programs to become more robust and allow practitioners to see
which OHIs are the most common.
