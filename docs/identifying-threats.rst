Identifying and Mitigating Threats
==================================

The MITRE ATT&CK® framework has mapped data sources and mitigations, where applicable,
to each of the techniques detailed in the ATT&CK for Enterprise knowledge base. These
have been validated in terms of external actors, but the Center research team behind the
Insider Threat Knowledge Base is validating these for their applicability to insider
threats as well. The Center team is working under the assumption that many or most of
the mitigations and data sources listed will help both efforts, but that there will
likely be some differences or additional data sources and mitigations for insider
threat.

Mitigations
-----------

Mitigations have been identified through their mappings to ATT&CK® TTPs and through
validation by Center participants. Currently all insider threat TTPs within the
Knowledge Base are also TTPs in ATT&CK, therefore the team has reviewed all
corresponding mitigations defined in ATT&CK. All mitigations for ATT&CK for enterprise
are relevant to insider threats. Through discussion with project participants, further
mitigations may be identified in the future. The table below details the tactic,
technique, and mitigation mappings specific to insider threat.

Data Sources
------------

Data sources that are useful for providing relevant information for insider threat
identification have been detailed. Identifying the most common data sources to detect
insider threat will enhance the community's ability to mitigate insider threats. The
data sources have been identified first through mappings from ATT&CK, like the
mitigations, with follow-on confirmation from project participants. The table below
details the tactic, technique, and data source mappings specific to insider threat.
