Knowledge Base

Cases
-----

Project participants have submitted their cases into the portal and provided a sequential list of TTPs per case, with additional information on the data sources used to detect those TTPs, select observable human indicators, and notes about the subject. Our findings are therefore validated by both what TTPs were used by the subject and how these TTPs were detected in line with ATT&CK guidelines. The data in the knowledge base appears as the following: 

* Types of logs, analytics, or other methods to identify the threat including:

    * Data source(s) used to identify/validate each TTP within each case 

    * Format of each data source (if applicable) 

    * Existing analytics used to detect TTP (if applicable) 

    * Timestamps of each TTP to better understand the overall timeline 

* The tactic each technique corresponds to. Just like in Enterprise ATT&CK, a technique can fall under multiple tactics depending on how the insider used the technique in each case. Along the way, there may be insider actions that do not neatly fit into Enterprise ATT&CK tactics or techniques. Contributors can propose new or modified tactics and techniques in these circumstances. 

* Techniques can be modified from an existing Enterprise ATT&CK technique with new language to make it applicable to insider threats if required. 

* Brand new techniques can also be created when an existing technique is not sufficient.

The ATT&CK Navigator matrix below illustrates all of the TTPs seen to be used by insiders. This information stems from the case files submitted and illustrates the potential TTPs an enterprise could see in their network.
