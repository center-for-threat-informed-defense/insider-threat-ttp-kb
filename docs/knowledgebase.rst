Green = Seen: Insider Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
-----------------------------------------------------------

The ATT&CK® Navigator matrix - which the team calls the green = seen chart - illustrates all the TTPs seen to be used by insiders. This information stems from the case files submitted by participating organizations and illustrates the potential TTPs an enterprise could see in their network.

Data Collection
----------------

The data in the knowledge base is reported by contributors and validated by the CTID research team. It is represented as TTPs used by the subject and method of detection, in line with ATT&CK. Data in the knowledge base is collected through submissions by data contributors into a secure case submission portal. Contributors provided a sequential list of TTPs per case, with additional information on the data sources used to detect those TTPs, observable human indicators, and notes about the subject. The data in the knowledge base includes the following:
