Green = Seen: Insider Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
---------------------------------------------------------

The ATT&CK® Navigator matrix below (which the team calls the "green = seen" chart)
depicts the TTPs observed in the case data submitted by participating organizations.
This illustrates the potential TTPs an enterprise could see in their network.

Data Collection
----------------

The data in the knowledge base is reported by contributors and validated by the Center's
research team. It is represented as TTPs used by the subject and method of detection, in
line with ATT&CK. Data in the knowledge base is collected through submissions by data
contributors into a secure case submission portal. Contributors provided a sequential
list of TTPs per case, with additional information on the data sources used to detect
those TTPs, observable human indicators, and notes about the subject. The data in the
knowledge base includes the following:
