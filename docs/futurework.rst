Additional OHIs
----------------
Adding more OHIs to the current list of OHIs will allow insider threat programs to become more robust. Collecting more metrics about an insider threat actor will allow practioners to see which OHIs are more common and modify their insider threat programs to give more importance to those indicators. 

* Additional OHIs to consider are:

    * Tenure of the insider
    * Number of HR complaints against the insider
