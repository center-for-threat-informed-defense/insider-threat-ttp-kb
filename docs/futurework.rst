Future Work
===========

Case Collection
----------------
The portal will continue to be available and it will be accepting cases for future analysis. When more cases have been collected, Center researchers will be able to do statistical analysis and create a more generalizable Knowledge Base. Currently the Knowledge Base consists of a subset of organizations and industries and future work will aim to broaden the scope. 

Additional OHIs
----------------
The collection of additional OHIs will allow insider threat programs to become more robust. Collecting more metrics about an insider threat actor will allow practitioners to see which OHIs are more common and modify their insider threat programs to give more importance to those indicators. 

* Additional OHIs to consider:

    * Tenure of the insider
    * Number of HR complaints against the insider
