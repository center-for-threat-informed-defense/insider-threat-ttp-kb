Future Work
===========

Case Collection
----------------
The portal will continue to be available and accepting cases for future analysis. Currently, the Knowledge Base consists of a subset of organizations and industries and future work will aim to broaden the scope. When more cases have been collected, Center researchers will be able to do additional statistical analysis and create a more generalizable Knowledge Base. 

Additional OHIs
----------------
Along with the OHIs that are currently being collected, the team is always on the lookout for additional data that should be collected. The collection of additional OHIs will allow insider threat programs to become more robust and allow practitioners to see which OHIs are the most common.
