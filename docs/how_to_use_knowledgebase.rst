How to use the Knowledge Base
==============================

Getting Started
---------------
The Insider Threat knowledge base can be used in many different ways, from brand new insider threat programs to the vastly mature. 
The Center team has compiled several ways that the knowledge base has been used in the past, however it is not comprehensive or perscriptive and the team would love to hear of the other great ways programs are using the work.

Let's break down the two primary use cases for the knowledge base:

--------------------------------
1. Mitigation of Insider Threat
--------------------------------

Using the :doc:`heatmap </analysis>`, an organization can determine the most frequently used tactics and techniques and therefore quickly mitigate those before moving to some of the less commonly used TTPs. 

.. admonition:: Example of using the heatmap

    1. Choose the techniques in the heatmap that are colored red, and refer to :doc:`mitigations </mitigationsanddatasources>` to find their corresponding mitigation.
