Introduction
============

Project Goal 
-------------
The goal of the Insider Threat TTP Knowledgebase project is to create a repository of insider threat tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) based on cases seen throughout diverse industries such as healthcare, finance, and technology. These insider threat cases will allow practitioners to gain insight into the TTPs that insider threat actors use, and help protect organizations identify future insider threat. By understanding the most commonly used TTPs, insider threat programs can take conscientious action to defend their systems.  

Why ATT&CK® 
-----------
MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. ATT&CK® is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

The Insider Threat TTP Knowledge Base uses this framework as a basis for collecting information about insider threat cases. The Knowledge Base aligns this evidence to existing Enterprise ATT&CK® TTPs and mitigations. The Enterprise ATT&CK® matrix provides the baseline for the techniques identified by project participants. The participating organizations have identified insider techniques within actual case files corresponding to existing techniques and proposed new techniques deemed novel or unique to insider threats. As the Knowledge Base evolves, we anticipate discovering and documenting new insider techniques that may not fit within Enterprise ATT&CK®. These novel insider techniques will be added to our Knowledge Base. Eventually, the Knowledge Base will consist of a mix of techniques referenced in Enterprise ATT&CK®, as well as techniques that are unique to insider threats.

Scoping the Insider Threat Knowledge Base
-----------------------------------------
The Insider Threat TTP Knowledge Base project addresses the unique challenges that insider threats pose by starting with a modest scope in pursuit of an evidence-based result. We have constrained this research effort to the technical mechanisms that insiders use on information technology (IT) systems. This means that we deliberately exclude physical insider threat actions, such as workplace violence or smuggling documents on one’s person; those are non-technical and independent of IT systems. For the scope of this project, we likewise disregard discussions of the insider’s motive or what the insider did and could do once off the IT systems. This distinction is important. Within a single organization, different departments that have purview over insider threat may and do define the insider differently. This project compounds that complexity by seeking to rigorously define insider TTPs that can be used across all organizations. We were able to meet this goal by defining insider TTPs for security operations centers and cyber defenders, and by following the model of the Enterprise ATT&CK® framework, which is well-established for SOCs and cyber defense professionals. 

Method and Design 
------------------
Network defenders often focus on the TTPs of high-profile insider threat cases, such as Manning, Snowden, or Hanssen, causing them to overlook more mundane but equally damaging actions. This focus on one-in-a-million cases leads to prioritizing what is possible rather than what is probable, leading to speculative defense strategies. Researchers have categorized these TTPs as "could," consisting of actual, hypothetical, and fantastical insider actions.
However, organizations can shift their focus to actionable mitigation, detection, and response by using the Insider Threat TTP Knowledge Base which can inform defenders where their resources are best spent. The TTPs in the Knowledge Base are actions insiders "did" and have been observed in documented case files, providing a data-driven approach to insider threat defense. This enables organizations to better allocate their limited resources and focus their efforts where they are most beneficial. See the green=seen section to view the current techniques that are categorized as "did".
